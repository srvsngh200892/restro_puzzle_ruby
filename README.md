# restro_puzzle_ruby

write a code

that accepts the restro price file, and a list of item labels that someone wants to eat

for dinner, and display the restrothey should go to, and the total price it will cost

them. It is okay to purchase extra items, as long as the total cost is minimised. If

multiple restro are found, output any restro ID with the minimum price.

Don't output all restro IDs AND PRICEs. You can safely assume that

single quantity for any menu item will be asked by the user.
